## Deployment

This project can be deployed using multiple methods:

### 1. Netlify Deployment (Primary)

The project is deployed on Netlify with continuous deployment from the main branch:

1. The `netlify.toml` file contains the build configuration
2. The `netlify-build.sh` script handles the build process
3. Automated deployment occurs on every push to the main branch

**Live Netlify deployment: [https://brokerdemo.netlify.app/](https://brokerdemo.netlify.app/)**

### 2. GitHub Pages Deployment

The project is also automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Any changes pushed to the main branch will trigger a new deployment.

#### GitHub Pages Configuration

To ensure proper deployment to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section in the sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment", set the source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Make sure the GitHub Actions workflow has the necessary permissions:
   - Go to Settings > Actions > General
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Save the changes

You can access the GitHub Pages demo at: https://kordikp.github.io/broker-polirural/

### 3. Vercel Deployment

Vercel configuration is provided in the `vercel.json` file, which ensures proper routing for the SPA application.

## CSS Styling System

The project uses a carefully layered CSS styling system:

1. **Reset CSS** (`src/reset.css`): Resets browser default styles
2. **Farm Colors** (`src/farm-colors.css`): Defines theme color variables and classes
3. **Main Styles** (`src/main-styles.css`): Contains core layout and component styles
4. **App Styles** (`src/App.css`): Application-specific overrides
5. **Component Styles**: Individual component CSS files

CSS files are imported in the correct order in `App.tsx` to ensure proper cascading and priority.

## Latest Updates

- Fixed styling issues with consistent color application throughout the application
- Enhanced footer component to ensure proper text contrast on dark backgrounds
- Implemented CSS reset and proper styling hierarchy for predictable rendering
- Added multi-platform deployment support with primary deployment on Netlify
- Enhanced map loading experience with better visual indicators
